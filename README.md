# FE7-100-Growth-Rate
FEBuilder slop by me. Say goodbye to savestate abuse to squeeze that stat growth.

Also cooked the all items unbreakable and all stats uncapped to 127 just because I can :)

New patch: since uncapped patch is quite broken I have made a new patch, giving +20 caps to all stats for unpromoted and promoted adjusted based on the original promoted cap such that

30 -> 63
29 -> 62
28 -> 61

Up until

20 -> 53

Well, use https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/ to patch your Fire Emblem (US, Australia) and you're good to go.
